# Nekretnine

Real estate listing site, the main features are search and results pages that query a MariaDB database in the backend and show each row result on the frontend using ejs, a html templating engine. Each real estate object has it's own page from which they can be ordered. The project uses the Express web framework for routing and cdk8 for infrastructure which was made with `cdk8s init typescript-app`

The search page, showing only the available type of real estate object

There is an admin part where real estate objects can be configured alongside the locations and types of real estate objects

TODO:
- [ ] Make nekretnine company agnostic, with assets configurable in the admin panel
- [ ] Add possibility to use docker (https://hub.docker.com/r/darthsim/imgproxy) / node.js (https://github.com/lovell/sharp) microservice for resizing images into thumbnail versions
- [ ] Improve page number logic on the search results pages
- [ ] Refactor backend code to make better use of async / await
- [ ] Make sure the English translation is complete (including switching database to English)
- [ ] Improve and refactor form search options to better categorize real estate objects from multiple areas
- [ ] Finish separating main pages and admin CSS

## Installation instructions

### Modify the .env file for the environment in use

This project uses the dotenv middleware to add key/value pairs from the .env file into the project as environment variables, the default values are

<details>
  <summary>Environment variables</summary>

  ```
  NODE_ENV = "production"
  ```

  Default production value, you may change it to development for debugging

  ```
  DB_HOST = "db"
  ```

  Should be set to the address of the database

  ```
  DB_USER = "testuser123"
  ```

  Should be set to the user who has control over the database

  ```
  DB_PASS = "testpass123"
  ```

  The password of the user who has control over the database

  ```
  DB_DB = "nekretnine"
  ```

  The name of the database itself

  ```
  DB_PORT = "3306"
  ```

  The port of the database

  ```
  COOKIE_SECRET = "testcookie123"
  ```

  Should be a random string, for cookie authentificaiton

  ```
  WEB_PASS = "testpass123"
  ```

  The password to the admin part of the site, should be strong (minimum 8 characters consiting of at least 1 uppercase and lowercase letter, 1 number and 1 special character)

  ```
  WEB_PORT = "8000"
  ```

  The port the website will listen on
</details>

### Install the app

At this point you have the option to use containers or to manually install the app

<details>
  <summary>CDK for Kubernetes</summary>

  cdk8 can be installed with `npm install -g cdk8s-cli typescript`

  Running `npm run build` will create a dist/nekretnine.k8s.yaml file which can be deployed with `kubectl apply -f dist/`

  The deployed cluster will be similar to to the one created by Docker compose in the Docker instructions
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Docker</summary>

  Docker can be found on the official site: https://www.docker.com

  Running `docker compose --env-file ../.env up` will build the Dockerfile in the root directory and start 2 containers, the nodejs site and a MariaDB database, populated with some sample data

  Alternatively, if you configured the .env file with another database you can skip using docker compose and run just the nodejs container like this:

  ```
  docker build -t nekretnine:latest .
  docker run --name nekretnine -d --restart unless-stopped -p 8000:8000 nekretnine:latest
  ```
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Manual instructions</summary>

  These commands should be run inside the root folder of the project, i'm assuming you'll be running them on Linux but they can easily be modified for Windows

  #### Install nodejs and the dependencies for the app

  Node.js can be found on the offical site: https://nodejs.org

  With Node.js installed, running `npm install` will download and install all the needed dependencies

  #### Import the database

  The database in use by the project is MariaDB which is cross compatible with MySQL, first the database for app should be created:

  ```
  mysql -u root -p -e "CREATE DATABASE nekretnine"
  ```

  Then the schema should be imported into the created database

  ```
  mysql -u root -p nekretnine < nekretnine.sql
  ```

  There is dummy data available in the repository with locations for the NiÅ¡, Serbia area. It can be imported like this:

  ```
  mysql -u root -p nekretnine < data.sql
  ```

  All of these commands will prompt for the password of the root user

  #### Running the app

  The app can be started with a shell script that will automatically start the app and restart it should it crash

  ```
  cd src && sh app.sh
  ```

  alternatively, the app.js file can be ran directly directly with npm

  ```
  npm start
  ```
</details>

## Visiting the website

After starting the app, the website can be visited on the following address: http://localhost:8000

Logging using the morgan middleware can be achieved with setting the logging environment variable to 1 like `logging=1 node app.js`, the format of the logs can be configured, more info can be found [here](https://github.com/expressjs/morgan#predefined-formats)

A log file rotator is also in use, the availble options are documented on the [middleware page](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rotating-file-stream#options)
