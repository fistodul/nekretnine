# Nekretnine
Real estate listing site, the main features are search and results pages that query a MariaDB database in the backend and show each row result on the frontend using ejs, a html templating engine. Each real estate object has it's own page from which they can be ordered.

The search page, showing only the available type of real estate object

# Installation instructions
These instructions will assume that the installation is done on a linux local environment and that the commands are run inside the root folder of the project but it can easily be modified to installing on windows machines or an online hosting platform as a version of this app is already live
## Install nodejs and the dependencies for the app
Node.js can be found on the offical site: https://nodejs.org

With Node.js installed, running `npm install` will download and install all the needed dependencies
## Import the database
The database in use by the project is MariaDB which is cross compatible with MySQL, first the database for app should be created:
```
mysql -u root -p -e "CREATE DATABASE nekretnine"
```
Then the schema should be imported into the created database
```
mysql -u root -p nekretnine < nekretnine.sql
```
There is dummy data available in the repository with locations for the NiÅ¡, Serbia area. It can be imported like this:
```
mysql -u root -p nekretnine < data.sql
```
All of these commands will prompt for the password of the root user
## Modify the .env file for the environment in use
This project uses the dotenv middleware to add key/value pairs from files into the project as process.env environment variables, the variables in use are:
```
DB_Host = "localhost"
```
Should be set to the address of the database
```
DB_User = "root"
```
Should be set to the user who has control over the database
```
DB_Pass = ""
```
The password of the user who has control over the database
```
DB_Db = "nekretnine"
```
The name of the database itself
```
Cookie_secret = "testcookie123"
```
Should be a random string, for cookie authentificaiton
```
Site_Pass = "testpass123"
```
The password to the admin part of the site, should be strong (Minimum of 8 characters consiting of at least 1 uppercase and lowercase letter, 1 number and 1 special character)
# Running the app
The app can be started with a shell script that will automatically start the app in production mode and restart it should it crash
```
sh app.sh
```
alternatively, the app.js file can be ran directly directly with the NODE_ENV=production environment variable
```
NODE_ENV=production node app.js
```
After starting the app, the website can be visited on the following address: http://localhost:3000

Logging using the morgan middleware can be achieved with setting the logging environment variable to 1 like `logging=1 node app.js`, the format of the logs can be configured, more info can be found here: https://github.com/expressjs/morgan#predefined-formats

A log file rotator is also in use, the availble options are documented on the middleware page: https://www.npmjs.com/package/rotating-file-stream#options
